### Getting Started

You can sign in or create an account by going to the Account section. You can sign in with your email, or quickly sign in with Google for easier access.

### Scanning & Wine Recognition

#### How do I scan a wine bottle?
To scan a wine bottle, tap the Camera icon on the home screen. Point your phone's camera at the bottle label and capture the image. The app will analyze the label and provide detailed information about the wine, including how well it matches your flavor profile.

#### How does the app identify wines?
The app uses a combination of image recognition and a wine database to identify wine labels. It pulls information about the wine's region, type, and grape varietals, then compares it to your flavor profile to give you a recommendation.

#### What if the app can't recognize the wine I scanned?
If the app is unable to recognize the wine, it may be due to a low-quality image or missing information in the wine database. Try taking a clearer photo or manually entering the wine's details for a personalized recommendation.

#### Can I scan a wine menu at a restaurant?
Yes! Use the app to scan a printed wine menu. The app will suggest the top three wines based on your flavor profile. To scan, simply tap the Camera icon and select the menu scanning option.

### Flavor Profiles & Scoring

#### What is a Flavor Profile, and why should I set one up?
A Flavor Profile helps the app understand your wine preferences, such as sweetness, acidity, and boldness. By setting up your flavor profile, you'll receive wine recommendations tailored to your taste, both when scanning wine bottles and browsing wine aisles or menus.

#### How can I create or update my Flavor Profile?
You can create or update your flavor profile by going to Account > Flavor Profiles. There, you can manually enter your taste preferences or allow the app to generate a profile based on your scanned wines.

#### What is the Similarity Score and how does it work?
The Similarity Score indicates how well a wine matches your unique flavor profile. It considers tasting notes, mouthfeel, and winemaking techniques, rather than just grape varietals, for a more holistic match.

Score Levels:
• Perfect Match! (90-100): Exceptional alignment with your preferences
• Very Good Match (75-89): Strong alignment with your profile
• Good Match (50-74): Shares some aspects of your preferences
• Low Match (Below 50): Differs significantly from your preferences

The score is calculated by analyzing:
• Flavor Profile Matching: Focus on tasting notes and mouthfeel
• Grape Substitution: Similar characteristics across different varietals
• Region and Type: Climate and wine style considerations
• Winemaking Techniques: Impact of production methods on flavor

### Managing Your Wines

#### How do I save a wine to my favorites?
After scanning a wine, simply tap the Save button on the wine's details page to add it to your Favorites. You can access your saved wines anytime by visiting the Favorites section in the app.

#### Can I view my past scans?
Yes, all your past scans are saved in the Activity section. Here, you can review the details of previously scanned wines, including the scores and flavor details.

#### How can I delete a scan or favorite wine?
You can delete a scan from the Activity section by selecting the scan and tapping the Delete button. Similarly, you can remove wines from your Favorites by navigating to the wine and selecting the delete option.
